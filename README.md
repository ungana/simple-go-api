go run *.go
```

The project will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Available Routes

- GET [http://localhost:8080/items](http://localhost:8080/items)

__Example Request__

```bash
curl GET http://localhost:8080/items
```

- POST [http://localhost:8080/item](http://localhost:8080/item)

__Example Payload__

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "New Item", "value": 30}' http://localhost:8080/item
```
